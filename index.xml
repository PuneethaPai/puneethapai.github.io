Simple Example from above reference:

Configure to log in specific file, with specific format Config can be saved in YAML syntax and read also.</description></item><item><title>Python: regex, concurrency</title><link>https://puneethapai.github.io/logs/2020/september/21/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Sep 2020 16:53:20 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://puneethapai.github.io/logs/2020/september/21/</guid><description>Regex: Python built in re module is really handy.

Thanks!
I do believe that the only way is through. I agree that in this fast paced society, we may not get enough time to explore the concepts and learn to the depth we would want to. It is easier to fall back to &amp;ldquo;finding shortcuts, quick answers&amp;rdquo; strategy.
Even though I say all these, I truly am greatful to the larger community and platforms like Stackoverflow, Quora, chat forums, etc.</description></item><item><title>The Only Way Is Through: Part1</title><link>https://puneethapai.github.io/blogs/miscellaneous/only-way-is-through/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Sep 2020 07:00:17 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://puneethapai.github.io/blogs/miscellaneous/only-way-is-through/</guid><description>It has been 4 years in my professional career. Till date I have been always finding cool shortcuts to achieve the task or learn some new thing for career growth, etc.
It has served me well, so far at least. But lately it is becoming more evident, that the idealogy to keep finding shortcuts, solved examples is not working out. I am missing the actual point. Instead of learning or doing the task, in right way, I keep spending my time, energy and focus into finding the best solution awailable, easy ways to do, quick starts, ready made solution etc.</description></item><item><title>September 4, 2020</title><link>https://puneethapai.github.io/logs/2020/september/4/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Sep 2020 19:55:41 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://puneethapai.github.io/logs/2020/september/4/</guid><description>Data Ethics: Feedback, automation is nice thing, but we need to have proper monitoring reporting stuff in place to check for bias in model prediction. Especially when the model decides it's next set of input we need to be careful to verify that it is learning on general representative data. All data is biased, but trasperancy about how, why it was collected, etc can help us understand inherant bias in our data set.</description></item><item><title>September 1, 2020</title><link>https://puneethapai.github.io/logs/2020/september/1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2020 11:44:52 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://puneethapai.github.io/logs/2020/september/1/</guid><description>Catostrophic forgetting: Fine tuned model for a specific task would be less good at the previous generic task on which it was pre-trained. This is called catastrophic forgetting. To retain the earlier learning you would want to revision by feeding few samples from previous task along with samples from our new specific task. Are p-values really that valuables? In hypothesis testing (I do get confused everytime) based on value of p we may either reject the null hypothesis (Ho) else we fail to reject Ho.</description></item><item><title>Aug 27, 2020</title><link>https://puneethapai.github.io/logs/2020/august/27/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Aug 2020 15:18:11 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://puneethapai.github.io/logs/2020/august/27/</guid><description>FastAI Deep learning for coders: Course Link: https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson1=

Notes:
while training a Classification NN, we will have learnt theta min for L(theta, f, D) is minimum we have final layer where P(y/x) is predicted If we compute P(a/y) at previous layers and reduce n/w computations How much back we can come in layers? Will it actually reduce computation and optimises state of the art NN?</description></item><item><title>Just a dream. or is it !!</title><link>https://puneethapai.github.io/blogs/thoughts/just-a-dream-or-is-it/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jun 2020 22:22:14 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://puneethapai.github.io/blogs/thoughts/just-a-dream-or-is-it/</guid><description>Suddenly I was following a woman carrying a huge box in her hands.

There she was her sister whom I thought was cute. She looked at me, we were sharing a surprised look. I could notice she was a little frustrated over something her elder sister had done.
They both started to argue on something.</description></item><item><title>Hugo</title><link>https://puneethapai.github.io/blogs/miscellaneous/hugo/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Apr 2020 20:31:23 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://puneethapai.github.io/blogs/miscellaneous/hugo/</guid><description>Get Started Create new site:
