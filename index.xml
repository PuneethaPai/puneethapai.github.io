We needed abstractive summary, also way to train model with data = (man page content, tldr summary) Found way to parse man pages for commands using groff $ groff -man -T utf8 $(man -w cp) $ tldr groff groff Typesetting program that reads plain text mixed with formatting commands and produces formatted output.</description></item><item><title>2020-08-05</title><link>https://puneethapai.github.io/logs/august-2020/5/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Aug 2020 11:07:49 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://puneethapai.github.io/logs/august-2020/5/</guid><description>Stanford CS330: Multi-Task and Meta-Learning, 2019 | Lecture 2 - Multi-Task &amp;amp; Meta-Learning Basics
Notes:
while training a Classification NN, we will have learnt theta min for L(theta, f, D) is minimum we have final layer where P(y/x) is predicted If we compute P(a/y) at previous layers and reduce n/w computations How much back we can come in layers? Will it actually reduce computation and optimises state of the art NN?</description></item><item><title>Just a dream. or is it !!</title><link>https://puneethapai.github.io/blogs/thoughts/just-a-dream-or-is-it/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jun 2020 22:22:14 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://puneethapai.github.io/blogs/thoughts/just-a-dream-or-is-it/</guid><description>Suddenly I was following a woman carrying a huge box in her hands. I wasnâ€™t sure why we both were in a hurry. I followed her to her place.
There she was her sister whom I thought was cute. She looked at me, we were sharing a surprised look. I could notice she was a little frustrated over something her elder sister had done.
They both started to argue on something.</description></item><item><title>Hugo</title><link>https://puneethapai.github.io/blogs/miscellaneous/hugo/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Apr 2020 20:31:23 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://puneethapai.github.io/blogs/miscellaneous/hugo/</guid><description>Get Started Create new site:
