### FastAI Deep learning for coders:

Course [Link](https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=1)

Note: I had started with Machine Learning course from FastAI [Link](https://course18.fast.ai/ml.html)

Lesson 1:

#### Summary:

- Myths and actual truth around practical Deeplearning
- Top down approach for practical DL over bottom up approach followed in academia
    - Base ball analogy for the same
- Libraries covered Python -> Pytorch -> FastAI
- Jupyter Notebooks:
    - REPL (Read Execute Print Look)
    - Similar to shell/terminal
    - More interactive and fetures (GUI, rendering, etc)
    - Shifting from IDE to Jupyter env feels exactly like shifting from GUI to terminal
    - We stick to terminal over GUI so stick with Jupyter.(Whole book, library, docs was written in Jupyter notebook)
- Traditional ML vs DeepLearning

#### IMP:
- Each chapter is in each notebooks
- Questions section instead of summary
