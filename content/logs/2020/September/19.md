## CSV dict writer:

Dict Reader and Writer are most flexible ways to manipulate csv data.

Both reader and writer supports **generators** and hence can work in **low memory systems** pretty efficiently.

#### Example:

```python
import csv
from typing import Iterable, Dict


def read_csv(path: str) -> Iterable[Dict]:
    """Reads csv and yeilds row as dict"""
    with open(path, "r", newline="") as f:
        reader = csv.DictReader(f)
        for row in reader:
            yield row


def write_csv(path: str, data: Iterable[Dict], header: list = None) -> None:
    """Writes data: Iterable[Dict] into csv file"""
    if not header:
        header = data[0].keys()
    with open(path, "w+", newline="") as f:
        writer = csv.DictWriter(f, header)
        writer.writeheader()
        writer.writerows(data)
```

## Subprocess:

Subprocess run with `shell=True` sucks for some reason. This may be because, certain commands 
opens up temporory buff file as output like commands `less`, `man`, `git log`, etc. Following 
is a pretty handy subprocess execution for any command.

```python
from typing import List
import subporcess as sp

def get_process_output(command: List[str], timeout: int = 5) -> str:
    """Executes command and returns it's execution output"""
    try:
        process = sp.run(command, timeout=5, text=True, stdout=sp.PIPE, stderr=sp.PIPE)
        return process.stdout if process.returncode == 0 else process.stderr
    except sp.SubprocessError as e:
        return str(e)
```

## pathlib.Path

Really handy path library. Some useful methods are:

```python
from pathlib import Path

path = Path("some/path/")

# File/Folder Name
path.name 

# Read
path.read_text()
path.read_bytes()

# Write
path.write_text("data")
path.write_bytes(b"data")

# Navigation
path / "some/other/file"
path / "some" / "other" / "file"

# Listing all files
paths_matching_pattern = path.glob("*pattern*") # Eg: *.csv, *.md, *.jpg, etc
all_files = list(path.iterdir()) # List all files and folders in `path`

assert list(path.glob("*")) == list(path.iterdir()) # True
```
