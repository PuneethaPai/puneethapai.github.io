#### Data Ethics:

- Feedback, automation is nice thing, but we need to have proper monitoring
  reporting stuff in place to check for bias in model prediction.
- Especially when the model decides it's next set of input we need to be
  careful to verify that it is learning on general representative data.
- All data is biased, but trasperancy about how, why it was collected, etc
  can help us understand inherant bias in our data set.
- Model learning in production from feedback can create +ve feedback loop and
  extrapolate inherant baises in data. Domino effect _(Small brick starting
  huge chain of reactions)_
