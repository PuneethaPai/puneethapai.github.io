#### Catostrophic forgetting:

- Fine tuned model for a specific task would be less good at the previous
  generic task on which it was pre-trained.
- This is called catastrophic forgetting.
- To retain the earlier learning you would want to revision by feeding few
  samples from previous task along with samples from our new specific task.

#### Are p-values really that valuables?

- In hypothesis testing _(I do get confused everytime)_ based on value of p
  we may either reject the null hypothesis (Ho) else we fail to reject Ho.
  Ho is never truly accepted.
- Inference itself is hard, statistical inference is much harder. All you
  can do is remove all other possibilities and finally conclude this is right
  inference.
- Here is a statement from American Statistical Association. [Statement](https://github.com/PuneethaPai/puneethapai.github.io/blob/source/static/papers/P-ValueStatement.pdf)

#### Frequentist vs Bayesian Statistical Approaches:

- Comparison of frequentist vs Bayesian method for probability. [Good Read](https://www.digitalvidya.com/blog/frequentist-vs-bayesian/).
- Three ways of looking at probability:
  - Frequency of event happening in long run _(Frequentist)_
  - Degree of belief of event happening _(Bayesian)_
  - Extension of logical probability _(Bayesian)_
- Same data can be viewed with both persepectives. Frequentist approach cannot
  assign probability to events which are non repeatable while bayesian approach can.
  _(For example probability trump wins which is not repeatable for many times)_
- Frequentist approach gives maximum likely hood estimate with confidence interval.
- But applying it just based on p-value and significance is wrong approach.
- Best test when we are doing frequentist NHST is to taking Ho to be contrary
  to earlier Ho and see if it still holds.
- In most of 20th century frequentist and NHST _(Null Hypothesis Significance Test)_
  was used everywhere, but wrongly applied.
- In recent 15-20yrs people have realised advantage of Bayesian approach and renoved
  practitioner of this approach blame on quality of research which just relies on `NHST`
  and `p-value` for significance.
- Bayesian approach takes into consideration other factors _(their prior probability)_ + data
  to comment on posterior probablity of parameter.
    $$P(^\theta/_{Data}) = \frac {P(^{Data}/ _\theta) \cdot P(\theta)} {P(Data)} $$
  - $$P(^\theta/_{Data}) = Posterior Probabiliy  $$
  - $$P(^{Data}/ _\theta) = Likely hood $$
  - $$P(\theta) = Prior probability $$
  - $$P(Data) = Evidence $$

#### Classical vs Quantum physics:

- I view frequentist vs bayesian to be similar to classical vs quantum physics.
- Classical physics applies and scales well at large scale objects.
- While quantum physics is more powerfull and generic. Classical physics is just
  a special and is derivable from quantum physics.
- As quantum physics gives probability of finding electron at different places, similarly
  Bayesian approach gives posterior probability of parameter given its prior and evidence.
