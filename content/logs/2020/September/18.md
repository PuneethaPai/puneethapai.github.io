### Python Debugging

`pdb` is a standard python debuger and to invoke it we can call `brakpoint()` in scripts or use `%pdb` magic in iPython. [Documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/library/pdb.html#debugger-commands)

In `pdb` pythons standard debugger, `help` command directs you further. Some shortcuts are `n` next line, `s` step into, `c` for continue. You can do anything w.r.t ipython shell.

#### IPython trics:

All and more about useful ipython %magic and debugging can be found here:

Great reference: https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/index.html

- `%lsmagic` to list all available magic commands
- `%<magic>?`: to understand the magic command more
- Debugging:
  - `%debug` will bring `pdb` from when exception was raised and hence you can check all variables
  - `%xmode Plain`, `%xmode Verbose`
  - `%pdb on`, `%pdb off`, `%pdb 1`, `%pdb 0`
  - To bring up `pdb` whenever exception is raised set `%pdb on`.
- Profiling:
  - `%time`: Time the execution of a single statement
  - `%timeit`: Time repeated execution of a single statement for more accuracy
  - `%prun`: Run code with the profiler
  - `%lprun`: Run code with the line-by-line profiler
  - `%memit`: Measure the memory use of a single statement
  - `%mprun`: Run code with the line-by-line memory profiler
- Listing variables:
  - `dir()`
  - `globals()`
  - `locals()`

##### Some of other tools/ways are:

- `from IPython import embed; embed()`
- `from import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace()`
