### xargs

xargs pipes output of previous command as list of input to next command.

What we can do is for each output from previous we can execute perticular command.

Example to move all files in a given folder to a subfolder inside.

```bash
ls -a | grep -v new_path | xargs -I % sh -c "mv % new_path"
```

Magics Revealed:

- `ls -a | grep -v new_path` ignores just _new_path_ and puts rest into out stream.
- `ls -a | grep -v new_path | xargs -I` now _xargs -I %_ puts each ouput line into variable `%` to refer in futher steps.
- `sh -c "command"` will start new subshell and executes `command`
