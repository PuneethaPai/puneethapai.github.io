## Exploring Abstractive vs Extractive Text summarization

- started with huggingface/transormers default pipeline model
    - Really well trained but thought it was only extractive.
    - We needed abstractive summary, also way to train model with data = (man page content, tldr summary)
- Found way to parse man pages for commands using `groff`
```bash
$ groff -man -T utf8 $(man -w cp)

$ tldr groff
groff

Typesetting program that reads plain text mixed with formatting commands and produces formatted output.
It is the GNU replacement for the `troff` and `nroff` Unix commands for text formatting.
More information: <https://www.gnu.org/software/groff>.

- Render a man page as plain text, and display the result:
    groff -man -T utf8 manpage.1

- Render a man page using the ASCII output device, and display it using a pager:
    groff -man -T ascii manpage.1 | less

- Render a man page into an HTML file:
    groff -man -T html manpage.1 > page.html

- Process a roff file using the `tbl` and `pic` preprocessors, and the `me` macro set:
    groff -t -p -me -T utf8 foo.me

- Run a `groff` command with preprocessor and macro options guessed by the `grog` utility:
    eval "$(grog -T utf8 foo.me)"
```

## Results of exploration:
- [Good intro and exploration of abstractive vs extractive summarization](https://rare-technologies.com/text-summarization-in-python-extractive-vs-abstractive-techniques-revisited/#abstractive_text)
- Extractive:
    - Gensim.TextRank --> Creates graph of sent-sent connected by similarity. Uses page rank to decide sentances to be selected for summary.
    - PyTextRnak --> Similar approach
    - LexRank --> Similar, but uses idf cosine similarity as edge weight
    - Latent Semantic Analysis --> [Read More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis#Latent_semantic_indexing)
        - Spacial decomposition of sentance to lower dimension
        - each singular vector can capture word combination patter
        - Magnitude of singular value represent presence of the pattern in sentance
- Abstractive:
    - TBD
- Measuring quality of generated summary:
    - Recall Based: 
        - ROUGE-N (based on n-gram, N == n-gram)
            - It is the ratio of the count of N-gram phrases which occur in both the model and gold summary, to the count of all N-gram phrases that are present in the gold summary.
    - Precision Based:
        - BLEU metric
            - It is the ratio of the count of N-gram phrases which occur in both the model and gold summary, to the count of all N-gram phrases that are present in the model summary.
        - BLEU with modified N-gram
            - weighted n-gram score. For example unigrams, bigrams and trigrams as 0.4, 0.3, 0.2 respectively.
