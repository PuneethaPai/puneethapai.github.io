Things which are unknown at the time:
- seq to seq encoding/learning (need not always be recurrent NNs)
- policy gradient for re-inforcement agent training
- reinforcement training in minimax two-player game fashion
- LSTM
    - Biderectional LSTM
- Two vectors are concatenated to consider both, but how and should learn Linear Algebra more
- Pointer-generator ([read more](http://www.abigailsee.com/2017/04/16/taming-rnns-for-better-summarization.html)) network to select b/w word generator from fixed vocab or pointer copying rare or un-
seen from the input sequence
- CNN for text classification
    - max overtime pooling (Pooling, max pooling I know what is overtime?)
