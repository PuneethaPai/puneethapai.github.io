**Do read [Part 1](https://puneethapai.github.io/blogs/miscellaneous/only-way-is-through/) if you haven't yet. Thanks!**

I do believe that the only way is through. I agree that in this fast paced society, we may not get enough time to explore the concepts and learn to the depth we would want to. It is easier to fall back to _"finding shortcuts, quick answers"_ strategy.

Even though I say all these, I truly am greatful to the larger community and platforms like Stackoverflow, Quora, chat forums, etc. These have connected many, created strong communities. But our intention when we use these platforms, shouldn't be to finding shortcuts. Rather we should use it to gain complete understanding. _(I think these platforms were made for same reason)_

#### Few more thoughts why we should strive for complete understanding:

- If everyone just adopt this shortcut strategy, everyone will endup with half backed knowledge.
- Let alone thinking out of the box, they can't apply their learning outside or sometimes even to those specific cases.
- When we communicate with each other with this half backed knowledge, each individuals prejudice gets enhanced, multiplied and grows exponentially with each interaction. Why because we can't explain ourselves.
- It surely is dangerous. As with each interaction transperancy and understanding in the concept shakes. Trust in concept will slowly die.
- **`Quick check: When you can't explain what you have learnt to someone else, did you truly learnt it or did you just memorized it?`**
