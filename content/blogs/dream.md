Suddenly I was following a woman carrying a huge box in her hands.
I wasn’t sure why we both were in a hurry. I followed her to her place.

There she was her sister whom I thought was cute.
She looked at me, we were sharing a surprised look.
I could notice she was a little frustrated over something her elder sister had done.

They both started to argue on something. I found a bean bag to rest on, while they continued.
I was a bit tired, I didn’t pay much attention to what they were arguing on!

“It’s almost the time” said elder sister.
They were packing their bags, I understood they were leaving to somewhere.

I wanted to talk to her. She seemed familiar and I could notice even she was sharing the same suspicion.
They were in a hurry I couldn’t interrupt.

Both took their luggage outside, suddenly the apartment was now my responsibility.
She was already waiting near the lift for her elder sister. I gave a hug to the elder one, then got busy to check on house and lock it
I wanted to say goodbye to her, but by then both had disappeared from my view.

I ran to stop the lift, but no use.
Checked the lift floor indicator, but discovered lift was coming up.
I understood they must have taken stairs.

I ran to the stairs, looked down, shouted her name (somehow now I know her name).
No use, they were already 3-4 floors away.

I started climbing down. On the way down found many keys(apartment, bike, cars, etc) fallen on stairs.
I thought it would be good to collect them and give at reception.
I was getting close to them, now we had only 2 floors of separation.

I finally reached down. They were walking towards the gate. There was alraedy a cab waiting at the entrance.
I shouted her name once again and fortunately she heard this time.
She smiled, looked back and started running towards me.
I ran and gave her a hug. I never felt so grateful, both of us were sharing smiles, blush and most importantly the moment.
I held her hand tight, fingers interlocked, took her bag and we walked towards the taxi. The Older one was already on board

We promised to meet again when she was back.

### Things it taught me:

Sometimes I get these beautiful dreams, which opens my eyes. :)

I learnt it is important to value each other's company when they are around.

Cherish each other's success, share sorrows, support each other and most importantly live in the present.

We have the power of what we want to be, live to our fullest and influence others too.
