It all started with a seemingly insignificant [bug](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/33740) that I encountered while working at [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-in). [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), a popular library widely used in the data science community, was the tool of choice for analyzing and manipulating data. However, I stumbled upon a bug in the library's merge functionality.

At first, I was skeptical about reporting the bug, but curiosity propelled me forward. I meticulously examined the library's code, line by line, and identified the specific code causing the issue. With this knowledge, I promptly reported the bug to the library's open-source repository.

To my surprise, the maintainers[[@jreback](https://github.com/jreback)] of the library responded on the same day with the encouraging words, "PR (pull request) would be accepted". These four simple words had a profound impact on me. They conveyed a sense of openness, inclusivity, and appreciation for contributions from the community.

Inspired by this positive response, I embarked on a journey of open-source contribution. Starting with the small bug fix ([my first PR](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/34208)), I actively sought out other open issues in libraries that I frequently used in my work. Gradually, I expanded my contributions to more than five open-source libraries or platforms ([All my contributions](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3APuneethaPai+archived%3Afalse+)).

Through this involvement, I forged new connections with fellow contributors, and gained recognition from esteemed data science communities like [DVC](https://dvc.org/) and [DagsHub](https://dagshub.com/). This also got me the opportunity to publish [blog posts](https://dagshub.com/blog/author/puneethp/) in collaboration with talented individuals from DagsHub. The experience was incredibly rewarding both personally and professionally.

As I continued to contribute, I dedicated every weekend to working on one or two pull requests. Each time my contributions were accepted and my name appeared in the list of collaborators, it filled me with a sense of accomplishment and pride. The open-source community had welcomed me with open arms, and I was grateful for the opportunity to make a meaningful impact.

Reflecting on this journey, I realized that even the smallest contributions can have a significant impact. Open-source software is built on the collective efforts of individuals who share a common goal of creating and improving tools that benefit everyone. By actively participating in the open-source community, I not only contributed to the development of valuable software but also gained invaluable skills, knowledge, and connections that have shaped my career.
