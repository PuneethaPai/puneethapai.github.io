Thanks!
I do believe that the only way is through. I agree that in this fast paced society, we may not get enough time to explore the concepts and learn to the depth we would want to. It is easier to fall back to &amp;ldquo;finding shortcuts, quick answers&amp;rdquo; strategy.
Even though I say all these, I truly am greatful to the larger community and platforms like Stackoverflow, Quora, chat forums, etc.</description></item><item><title>The Only Way Is Through: Part1</title><link>https://puneethapai.github.io/blogs/miscellaneous/only-way-is-through/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Sep 2020 07:00:17 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://puneethapai.github.io/blogs/miscellaneous/only-way-is-through/</guid><description>It has been 4 years in my professional career. Till date I have been always finding cool shortcuts to achieve the task or learn some new thing for career growth, etc.
It has served me well, so far at least. But lately it is becoming more evident, that the idealogy to keep finding shortcuts, solved examples is not working out. I am missing the actual point. Instead of learning or doing the task, in right way, I keep spending my time, energy and focus into finding the best solution awailable, easy ways to do, quick starts, ready made solution etc.</description></item></channel></rss>
