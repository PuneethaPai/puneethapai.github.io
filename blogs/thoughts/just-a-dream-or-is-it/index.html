I wasn’t sure why we both were in a hurry. I followed her to her place.</p><hr><p>There she was her sister whom I thought was cute.
She looked at me, we were sharing a surprised look.
I could notice she was a little frustrated over something her elder sister had done.</p><p>They both started to argue on something. I found a bean bag to rest on, while they continued.
I was a bit tired, I didn’t pay much attention to what they were arguing on!</p><hr><p>“It’s almost the time” said elder sister.
They were packing their bags, I understood they were leaving to somewhere.</p><p>I wanted to talk to her. She seemed familiar and I could notice even she was sharing the same suspicion.
They were in a hurry I couldn’t interrupt.</p><hr><p>Both took their luggage outside, suddenly the apartment was now my responsibility.
She was already waiting near the lift for her elder sister. I gave a hug to the elder one, then got busy to check on house and lock it.
I wanted to say goodbye to her, but by then both had disappeared from my view.</p><p>I ran to stop the lift, but no use.
Checked the lift floor indicator, but discovered lift was coming up.
I understood they must have taken stairs.</p><hr><p>I ran to the stairs, looked down, shouted her name (somehow now I know her name).
No use, they were already 3-4 floors away.</p><p>I started climbing down. On the way down found many keys(apartment, bike, cars, etc) fallen on stairs.
I thought it would be good to collect them and give at reception.
I was getting close to them, now we had only 2 floors of separation.</p><hr><p>I finally reached down. They were walking towards the gate. There was already a cab waiting at the entrance.
I shouted her name once again and fortunately she heard this time.</p><p>She smiled, looked back and started running towards me.
I ran and hugged her tight. I never felt so grateful, both of us were sharing smiles, blush and most importantly the moment.
I held her hand tight, fingers interlocked, took her bag and we walked towards the taxi. The Older one was already on board.</p><p>We promised to meet again when she was back and shook on it.</p><hr><h3 id=things-it-taught-me>Things it taught me:</h3><p>Sometimes I get these beautiful dreams, which opens my eyes. :)</p><p>I learnt it is important to value each other&rsquo;s company when they are around.</p><p>Cherish each other&rsquo;s success, share sorrows, support each other and most importantly live in the present.</p><p>We have the power of what we want to be, live to our fullest and influence others too.</p></main></div><footer id=footer class="mt-auto text-center text-muted"><div class=container>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a> & <a href=https://github.com/zwbetz-gh/vanilla-bootstrap-hugo-theme>Vanilla</a></div></footer><script src=https://puneethapai.github.io/js/feather.min.js></script>
